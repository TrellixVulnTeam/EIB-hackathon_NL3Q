Excellence in Breeding Hackathon 2018
======================

Date: Feb 5-8, 2018

Location: International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) Headquarters, Philippines

### What this repository contains ###
=====================

This site is a repository of all collected output from the hackathon. This includes tools as well as datasets used.

### Goals of the hackathon: ###
======================

* Solve important bioinformatics or biometrics problems in breeding

* Facilitate interaction between developers 

* Catalyze interaction between breeders and data analysts 

### Problems to solve: ###
====================

1. Organizing existing R scripts into a library, integrate it into Galaxy, optimize them (parallelize)

2. Add imputation (of any choice, eg., NPUTE, beagle, FSFhapmap) and Haplotype bin mapping in the Galaxy toolsheds in order to improve specificity/sensitivity of Genomic Selection pipeline

3. Marker subsets: Take large SNP data sets produced from GBS or similar and reducing them to a panel of useful markers for selection

4. Program to identify closest genotypes and genotypes with favorable allele/haplotype

5. Identifying genetic duplicates and cut offs for determining duplicates
